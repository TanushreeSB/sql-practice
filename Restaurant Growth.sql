To evaluate potential restaurant expansion, we need to understand the 7-day revenue trend.
A rolling or moving average helps smooth short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term patterns.

Approach:

1) Aggregate by Day:
First, compute total revenue per visited_on date.

2) Join with Past 6 Days:
For each date, gather the revenue of the current and previous 6 days.

3) Compute Moving Average:
Calculate the average of the 7-day window.

4) Filter Starting from Day 7:
Only show results where at least 7 days of data are available.

ðŸ§® Complexity:
Time Complexity:
O(n 
2
 ) in the worst-case due to the self-join per day, but manageable with indexes and limited dataset.

Space Complexity:
O(n) to store intermediate daily totals.
